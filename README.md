Project Overview
This section should provide a high-level summary of your project and set the context for the rest of the notebook.

Points to Include:
Project Title: "Random Forest Classifier for [Problem Type/Target Variable]"
Objective: "The objective of this project is to use the Random Forest Classifier to predict [target variable]. The model was trained on [mention dataset], and performance was evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and visualizations such as feature importance heatmaps."

Libraries Used:
Scikit-learn: For implementing Random Forest model and evaluation.
Seaborn: For creating statistical and feature-related visualizations.
Pandas: For data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing.
Matplotlib: For custom plots and visualizations.

Data Preprocessing:-
Data Cleaning:
"The dataset was cleaned by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and fixing any inconsistencies. Missing data was either imputed or removed."
Feature Encoding:
"For categorical features, we used One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding to convert categorical data into numerical values."
Splitting the Dataset:
"The dataset was divided into training and testing sets, typically with an 80/20 or 70/30 split, to ensure that the model could be tested on unseen data."
Choosing Random Forest:

"Random Forest was chosen for this classification task because of its ability to handle complex, high-dimensional data and its robustness to overfitting."
Training the Model:
"The model was trained using the RandomForestClassifier from Scikit-learn."
After training the model, we used the predict() method to make predictions on the test set."
Accuracy:
"The accuracy of the model was computed by comparing the predicted values with the true values from the test set. Accuracy is the proportion of correct predictions made by the model."
Confusion Matrix:
"The confusion matrix is used to evaluate the performance of the classification model. It provides the number of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN)."
Data Visualization:-
Confusion Matrix Heatmap:
"The confusion matrix can be visualized using a heatmap, which provides a clearer view of the classification results."
